## About Cofundable

Cofundable is an online grant-making platform that empowers local stakeholders to decide how and when funding is invested in their community. By pooling donations into a common fund then giving individuals the ability to award shares of that fund to the causes and organizations they believe in, we're increasing the impact of each dollar invested and moving the foundation out of the boardroom and into the neighborhoods where that work is being done.

## About this Repository

This repository serves as our [main issue tracker](https://github.com/cofundable/cofundable/issues) where the community can report bugs, request new features, and track progress on our product roadmap.
